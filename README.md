# Final Project

This is the code section for my final project.

### Notation meanings:

###### Auction
There are 4 types of auctions that can be combined:
- T1 - English
- T2 - Dutch
- T3 - First-price sealed-bid
- T4 - Vickrey

###### Auctioneer
The auctioneer has, at the moment, two rates: the first auction rate and the second auction rate. This can be seen in auction_information.py

##### Bidder
The bidder has three parameters:
- risk
- base rate
- utility

##### Functions
There are 4 functions connected to 4 profiles at the moment:
- *a* : constant function
- *b* : increasing function
- *c* : decreasing function
- *d* : non-monotonous function
